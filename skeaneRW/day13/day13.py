# day 13: debugging 

'''
use debugging tools to fix the following code:

def fizz_buzz(target):
    for number in range(1, target + 1):
        if number % 3 == 0 or number % 5 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        if number % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        if number % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print([number])

The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game.   
- Your program should print each number from 1 to x where x is the input number. 
- However when the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".   
- When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz". 
- And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz".
