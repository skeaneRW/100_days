dear Angie,

I am having a party next week and hope you can come.

We're all planning on bringing something delicious to eat. I thought you could bring your
world-famous lemon fish to the party. What do you think?

I'm going to wear that hat you got for me when we were in the Mall of America. Good times!

Sincerely,
Stephen
